                    The brand started as an idea when I reconnected with my mom during the COVID-19 times. 
        
        Quick backstory, my mum is an experienced tailor with more than 20 years of experience in women's fashion. Her work was affected by the coronavirus as many of us were. 
        
        After spending more time with her, I noticed a lot of potential for a great digital business. I tried to connect the knowledge she had with my skills in design and my humble business skills.
